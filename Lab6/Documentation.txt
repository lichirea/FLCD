FA.scan_input(file):
    reads through the give file and constructs the finite automata in memory;
    also prints out whether the FA is 
    Arguments:
        file: a string

FA.check_seq()
    initializez a final state, then applies all applicable transitions to it according to the sequence
    if the final state is valid, prints 'ACCEPTED'
    otherwise prints 'NOT ACCEPTED'
    Arguments:
    seq: a list of strings


Format of FA.in file:
- state ::= "p" | "q" | "r"
- initial_state ::= state
- final_states ::= state {" " state}
- states ::= state {" " state}
- element ::= "a" | "b"
- alphabet ::= element {" " element}
- transition ::= state " " element " " state
- transitions ::= transition {"\n" transition}
